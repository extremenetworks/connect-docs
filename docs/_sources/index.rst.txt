Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access all Connect functionality through 
`Exteme Management Center (XMC) <https://www.extremenetworks.com/product/extreme-management-center/>`_. 
It is important to login using a local user account that is member of the build-in authorization 
group *NetSight Adminitrators*. On a fresh install, this would be the **root** account.

After you have logged into XMC with the **root** account you should see the *Connect* tab in 
the left-hand navigation:

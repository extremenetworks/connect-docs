<p>Combining Extreme Networks Control (NAC) solution with McAfee’s (now
Intel) ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) allows network and security
administrators to ensure that only compliant devices are able to use the
network and its resources. Devices which are out-of-date can be forced
to update their signature database automatically and optionally also get
quarantined in case of non-compliance.</p>
<p>Devices are compliant</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If they have McAfee VirusScan Enterprise (VSE) running with an
updated signature database (DAT version) or</p></li>
<li><p>If they have McAfee EndPoint Security (ENS) running and their AMCore
status is “compliant”</p></li>

<div class="section" id="integration-overview">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Integration Overview</a><a class="headerlink" href="#integration-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The graphic below highlights the major components necessary for this
integration to work and the benefits it provides.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Hardware: Any switch or WLAN solution that can perform RADIUS
authentication for network devices and is supported by Extreme’s NAC
solution</p></li>
<li><p>Software Products: Extreme Management Center and Control (NAC)
solution need to be deployed on top of the network infrastructure.
Ensure the end-systems where the McAfee agent is installed are also
connected through wired/wirless ports where RADIUS authentication via
NAC is implemented.</p></li>
<li><p>Extreme Connect: Starting with 7.0, all Connect modules are
integrated with Management Center and thus automatically deployed as
soon as an Advanced license is available. Both the McAfeeEPO and
Extreme Control modules are required at minimum for this integration
to work. More benefits are achieved by also utilizing the Assessment
Adapter which also is part of the Connect installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>End-System Group: Automatic grouping of devices managed in ePO
within NAC improves visibility and operational processes. An
administrator can easily distinguish devices managed by ePO from
those which are not and assign corresponding policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Custom Data: Automatically augments NAC’s database with detailed
device information from ePO like the DAT version, device name,
operating system, and more. Administrators and help desk staff can
use OneView as a single pain of glass to get a deep insight into
end-system data.</p></li>
<li><p>Username: Populates the username retrieved from ePO within NAC.
This provides user context to NAC without the need to enable
802.1X authentication mechanisms. This feature can also be
disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>Device Type: Populates the more granular and reliable operating
system information retrieved from ePO within NAC.</p></li>
<li><p>XMC Events: generate a Management Center event for each McAfee
end-system which has a DAT version older than x days
(configurable) or is non-compliant (based on AMCore status). Those
Extreme Management Center events can be used to alarm admins about
end-systems which are out-of-date and need attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Quarantine: automatically quarantine end-systems which have a DAT
version older than x days (configurable) or are non-compliant
(based on AMCore status). This prevents out-of-date and thus
potentially infected end-systems to effect and harm other
end-systems or network resources.</p></li>
<li><p>ePO Update Task: triggers a client update task on the McAfee ePO
server for each end-system which has a DAT version older than x
days (configurable) or is non-compliant (based on AMCore status).
Ensures that all McAfee managed end-systems are update as soon as
possible.</p></li>
<li><p>ePO Agent Wakeup Task: triggers an agent wakeup task after
triggering and update task and waiting for the update to finish.
The agent wakeup task will force the agent to immediatley update
its latest DAT version status with the ePO server and thus enable
Connect to get the latest status much quicker in order to release
quarantined end-systems into the normal ACCEPT state.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="overall-integration-considerations">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Overall Integration Considerations</a><a class="headerlink" href="#overall-integration-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ePO integration with NAC supports different overall deployment
models with varying levels of security and functional benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Best:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>NAC: Deploy 802.1X (TLS or PEAP) for all devices that support it
and MAC authentication for other devices. Use policies/ACLs/VLANs
for enforcement of different device/user groups. Use guest portal
and captive portal for remediation of out-of-date devices.</p></li>
<li><p>ePO Integration:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Import data on devices including devicetype (not the username,
since this is now derived from the 1X authentication) from ePO</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically trigger a client update task for non-compliant
devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically trigger an agent wakeup task for non-compliant
devices and release it from the quarantine state in NAC.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate Extreme Management Center events/alarms for all McAfee
end-systems which are non-complinat to infrom the network and
ePO admins about devices that are missing regular updates.
Measures to prevent end-systems to get quarantined can be taken
based on these alarms.</p></li>
<li><p>Use assessment to also quarantine non-compliant devices. For
most implementations it is <strong>not</strong> recommended to use a
different VLAN for the assessment phase. This would require too
many VLAN changes which could result in more help desk calls
due to the complexity of this process. If you want to restrict
your users while in assessment, use a specific assessment
policy/ACL instead.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Highest level of security with secure authentication (1X), ePO
and NAC visibility and enforcement with integrated workflows</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic live inventory of your whole network infrastructure
(not only ePO-managed devices) with even more extra data added
from ePO (visibility, troubleshooting, support)</p></li>
<li><p>Guest support</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Better:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>NAC: Deploy with MAC authentication only (no 1X, portal for
guests) but use policies/ACLs/VLANs for enforcement of different
device groups</p></li>
<li><p>ePO Inegration: Import data on devices including devicetype and
username from ePO and automatically trigger a client update task
for non-compliant devices.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Automatically trigger a client update task for devices which
have a VSE DAT version older than X versions from the current
master catalog.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatically trigger an agent wakeup task for devices which
have been forced to update to quickly update their new DAT
version within ePO and release it from the quarantine state in
NAC.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate XMC events/alarms for all McAfee end-systems which
have a DAT version older than X versions to infrom the network
and ePO admins about devices that are missing regular updates.
Measures to prevent end-systems to get quarantined can be taken
based on these alarms.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Easy to deploy even in large environments (need to develop and
deploy different policies/ACLs/VLANs for each device group)</p></li>
<li><p>No need to “touch” each device to rollout 802.1X (of course,
ePO agents need to be deployed)</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic live inventory of your whole network infrastructure
(not only ePO-managed devices) with even more extra data added
from ePO (visibility, troubleshooting, support)</p></li>
<li><p>More substantial security gains through enforcing restrictive
policies/ACLs/VLANs based on known MAC address groups and
blocking unknown devices and keeping the devices up to date in
terms of their ePO DAT version.</p></li>
<li><p>Guest support</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Good:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>NAC: Deploy with MAC authentication only (no 1X, no captive
portal)</p></li>
<li><p>ePO Integration: Only import data on devices from ePO and popluate
them into the custom fields in NAC (no assessment, no user- or
devicetype overwrite)</p></li>
<li><p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Very easy to roll out even in large environments</p></li>
<li><p>No need to “touch” each device to rollout 802.1X (of course,
ePO agents need to be deployed)</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic live inventory of your whole network infrastructure
(not only ePO-managed devices) with extra data added from ePO
(visibility, troubleshooting, support)</p></li>
<li><p>Only minor security gains</p></li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Installation and Configuration</a><a class="headerlink" href="#installation-and-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First confirm that Extreme Management Center, Extreme Control (NAC) and
McAfee ePO are installed. Deploy the NAC solution on all LAN switches
and WLAN SSIDs where you want to authenticate and authorize end-systems
and integrate their data with ePO. Also deploy the ePO agents to those
devices which are authenticated via NAC. If you want to use the
functionality to trigger client update tasks in ePO to update devices
which have an out-of-date agent and DAT version, ensure that such a task
is defined and functional in ePO. Refer to the ePO configuration guide
for this.</p>
<p>If you are running an Extreme Management Center version prior to 7.0 you
will need to update to version 8.1.</p>
<p>Once you successfully installed Connect you can use the Connect tab
within the Management Center to configure the solution using your
browser.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use the corresponding configuration files which
can be found when login into your Extreme Management server using SSH
and navigating to</p>
<p>/usr/local/Extreme_Networks/XMC/wildfly/standalone/configuration/connect</p>
<div class="section" id="mcafee-epo-extension">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">McAfee ePO Extension</a><a class="headerlink" href="#mcafee-epo-extension" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order for Connect to retrieve device data from ePO a vendor specific
server extension must be installed on the ePO server.</p>
<p>First download the extension from the Extreme Management Center server
using your browser from this link (alter the link to use your XMC’s IP
address or hostname):</p>
<p>This should download a zip file named
<em>ExtremeNetworks-McAfee_ePO_Extension.zip</em>. Login to your McAfee ePO
server as an administrator and navigate to <em>SoftwareExtensions</em>. Use the
button at the top of the page to add the extension you just downloaded
from XMC. Once installed, you should see the custom third-party
extension from Extreme Networks appear on your list of extensions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="connect-config-extreme-control">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Connect Config: Extreme Control</a><a class="headerlink" href="#connect-config-extreme-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>If you don’t want Connect to add all ePO managed devices to an
end-system group in NAC disable the feature to “Add endsystems to
endsystem groups”. Otherwise all device MAC addresses retrived from ePO
will automatically be added to the NAC end-system group which you
configure on the</p>
<p>If you want to automatically import the username for all devices
retrieved from ePO into NAC you need to enable the following option:
“Update Kerberos username for endsystems“. If ePO has no username
associated with a device, then the existing username in NAC will not be
overwritten/deleted. Be aware that the user information retrieved from
ePO is not retrieved in real-time and can therefore not be used for user
authentication and authorization in NAC. Enable this option only if you
do not use any 1X authentication method and no authorization rules based
on user names. The username retrieved from ePO should only be used as
“additional data on an end-system”.</p>
<p>If you want to augment the device type detection within NAC by
retrieving the operating system information from ePO you need to enable
the following option: “Update devicetype for endsystems”. Since ePO uses
its agents to retrieve the operating system information the quality of
the data is usually very high and it is recommended to enable this
option. But be aware that this feature will overwrite any other device
type detection techniques used by NAC (DHCP, portal, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="connect-config-mcafeeepo">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Connect Config: McAfeeEPO</a><a class="headerlink" href="#connect-config-mcafeeepo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image212.png"><img alt="image2" src="../../_images/image212.png" style="width: 6.27014in; height: 3.71042in;" /></a></p>
<p>This config area offers the most important settings for the ePO
configuration and thus its options are outlined in more detail here:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Username</strong>: Username used to connect to the ePO API</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Password:</strong> Password used to connect to the ePO API</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Server IP:</strong> IP Address of the ePO API</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Server Port:</strong> TCP port of the ePO API. Default: 8443</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Poll interval in seconds:</strong> The time (in seconds) the module will
wait after each run. For example, if you want to run the
synchronization once per hour you can configure ‘3600’ here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Module loglevel:</strong> The module’s loglevel setting (DEBUG, INFO,
WARN, ERROR, FATAL). Default: ERROR</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Module enabled:</strong> En-/Disables the module. You will need to set
this to “true”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Update local data from remote service:</strong> If this is set to true,
data from the remote service will be used to update the internal
end-system table. It is recommended to set this option to “true”. You
will also need to set this to “true” if you want to populate the
username and device type from McAfee in NAC (see additional options
below). Default: true</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Default end-system group for all devices from McAfee ePO:</strong> The
default end-system group name where we assign all McAfee devices to
in NAC. If you don’t want end-systems from McAfee to be assigned to
this default group, configure a group name which doesn’t exist in
NAC. Default: GroupNameWhichDoesNotExistInNac</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enable Data Persistence:</strong> Enabling this option will force the
module to store end-system custom field and group membership data
into a file after each cycle. If this option is disabled, the module
will forget all data after a service restart, but in order to clean
already existing data, the corresponding .dat files have to be
deleted. Default: true</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Custom field to use:</strong> The number of the custom data field for each
end-system to store the data retrieved from ePO. Available values
are: 1,2,3 or 4. Default: 1</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Format of the incoming data for devices from McAfee ePO:</strong> Format
of the data that gets stored in the custom data field. You can chose
and combine any of the available variables: ipAddress, macAddress,
osType, osServicePackVersion, nodeName, userName, datVersion,
lastUpdate, installedProducts, isEndPointSecurityInstalled,
amCoreContentComplianceStatus. But be aware that ePO might update the
“lastUpdate” value for each device very regularly and Connect is
calling XMC’s API to refresh that value in all end-systems custom
fields. Depeding on your poll interval this might put a lot of stress
onto the XMC server and it is thus recommended to <em>_NOT_</em> use this
variable here. It should only be used if the poll interval is very
low (like once per day) and the number of end-systems isn’t too high
(below 1000). Dfault: NodeName=#nodeName#; OS=#osType#
(#osServicePackVersion#); User=#userName#; DAT Version=#datVersion#,
AMCoreCompliance=#amCoreContentComplianceStatus#,
installedProducts=#installedProducts#</p></li>
<li><p><strong>End-system group for decommissioned devices:</strong> The default
end-system group for devices which existed in ePO but have been
deleted. If you want to explicitly identifiy those devices and even
authorize them differently (since they are no longer managed by ePO
anymore and that could pose a threat) you can configure the group
they should automatically be moved to here and enable the
corresponding feature below. Make sure you manually create this
end-system group in NAC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remove device from other groups on decommission:</strong> Enable this to
move devices which have been deleted from ePO to the NAC end-system
group configured by the corresponding option above. If disabled,
devices won’t be automatically move to this group but rather stay
with their existing group membership(s). Default: false</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delete custom data in XMC for decommissioned devices:</strong> If a device
is deleted in ePO the end-system’s custom data field in XMC will be
cleared as well. On the one hand this will keep your data clean in
NAC but on the other hand it might often be helpful to still see the
(old) ePO data for those end-systems which have once been managed by
ePO. Default: false</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overwrite the existing username with the one acquired from McAfee
ePO:</strong> If set to “true” the username for devices retrieved from ePO
will overwrite the username which is already in NAC. If no username
could be retrieved from ePO for a given end-system, then no change is
performed in NAC. Be aware that this might mess up existing NAC
processes if you are already retrieving and using the username
through some other mechanism like 802.1X or Kerberos snooping –&gt;
this will be overwritten! Default: false</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Overwrite the existing device type for devices with the one
acquired from McAfee EPO:</strong> If set to “true” the device type
(operating system) retrieved from ePO will overwrite the device type
which is already in NAC. If no operating system could be retrieved
from ePO for a given end-system, then no change is performed in NAC.
Be aware that this might mess up existing NAC processes if you are
already retrieving and using the device type through some other
mechanism like DHCP snooping –&gt; this will be overwritten! But in
most cases this feature should improve your current method (at least
for end-systems managed by McAfee EPO) since the quality of the
information retrieved from ePO is usually very good. Default: false</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max DAT version difference between ePO and client before triggering
client update task:</strong> For example: If set to “2” and the difference
between the DAT version on ePO’s master catalog and the client’s DAT
version is at least 2 then a client update task is automatically
triggered. This task is executed by ePO Connect cannot guarantee that
the task will be executed successfully but if, it should update the
client’s DAT file. Setting this value to 0 will disable this feature.
Default: 1</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max DAT version difference between ePO and client before generating
a XMC event:</strong> For example: If set to “4” and the difference between
the DAT version on ePO’s master catalog and the client’s DAT version
is at least 4 then we will generate a new XMC event. The event will
appear in OneView’s “Alarms and Events” tab with event type “Console”
and category “OneFabricConnect”. This feature can be used to create
XMC alarms based on these events. These alarms could be configured to
alarm the via Email or trigger other mechanisms. Setting this value
to 0 will disable this feature. Default: 4.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max DAT version difference between ePO and client before
quarantining client via NAC:</strong> For example: If set to “7” and the
difference between the DAT version on ePO’s master catalog and the
client’s DAT version is at least 7 then the value for the
corresponding assessment test result will be set to 10 and “HIGH”.
You can use your NAC assessment configuration to automatically push
those end-systems to a quarantine role if required. Setting this
value to 0 will disable this feature. Default: 0</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Name of the ePO client task that Connect uses to trigger a DAT
version update for individual devices:</strong> Use the exact name as
defined in ePO. If you haven’t done so far, define a client task in
ePO that will update a client’s DAT file (and maybe even more like
the agent version, etc.). It will also find any client tasks where
the configured name is part of – so make sure the provided name is
unambiguous. Default: Update Agent</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time before client update task is aborted by EPO:</strong> Number of
minutes after which the EPO server should abort the client update
task. This value is sent to the EPO server when running the
“clienttask.run” web service call as an addtional parameter
(“abortAfterMinutes”). Setting this value to 0 disables this feature
- the parameter won’t be used when making the web service call.
Default: 10 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max number of client update tasks triggered per client per day:</strong>
To avoid triggering too many EPO client update tasks you can set this
limit to a non-zero value. We will stop triggering EPO client update
tasks after the configured maximum number of retries has been reached
for the current day. As soon as the next day starts (first run after
midnight), the count of retries per MAC address is automatically
reset to zero and client update tasks will be triggered again as long
as the device is still out of date (see
dat_file_max_difference_before_trigger_update_task) or the maximum
for that day has been reached again. Setting this value to 0 disables
this feature the code will trigger a client update task on each cycle
as long as the device is out of date - no matter how may
cycles/triggers per day. Default: 1 update task per client per day</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max number of XMC events generated per client per day:</strong> To avoid
generating too many XMC events you can set this limit to a non-zero
value. We will stop generating XMC events after the configured
maximum number of retries has been reached for the current day. As
soon as the next day starts (first run after midnight), the count of
retries per MAC address is automatically reset to zero and XMC events
will be generated again as long as the device is still out of date
(see dat_file_max_difference_before_generating_XMC_event) or the
maximum for that day has been reached again. Setting this value to 0
disables this feature the code will generate a XMC event on each
cycle as long as the device is out of date - no matter how may
cycles/triggers per day. Default: 1 event per day</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enable Assessment:</strong> If this is set to true, assessment data for
all devices managed by ePO will be made available to the assessment
adapter. The data will be updated on each cycle. So if, for example,
the McAfeeEPOHandler is configured to run every hour and the DAT
version of a device is running out-of-date it will take max. up to an
hour to populate this fact within NAC’s assessment process. Default:
false</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Request an immediate re-assessment of an end-system if its
DEVICEOUTOFDATE value changed:</strong> If this is set to true, a
re-assessment of each end-system where its DEVICEOUTOFDATE value
changed (either from “true” to “false” or the other way round) will
be requested from NAC. This will ensure that if, for example, an
end-system has been pushed to Quarantine since its DAT file version
was out-of-date but now it has updated the DAT version, it will
immediately be re-assessed and authorized properly. If this feature
is disabled, it might take hours/days for the end-system to update
its NAC policy/authorization depending on the NAC assessment
configuration for this end-system. This feature is only used if the
assessment feature is also enabled. Default: true</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use XAPI to trigger a reauth and thus also a re-assessment of an
end-system:</strong> If this is set to true, a re-assessment of an
end-system will not be performed via a XMC web service call but
rather executed directly on the access switch of the end-system. This
will be executed via XAPI so “enable web http(s)” needs to be
configured on each XOS switch. This will execute the command ‘clear
netlogin state mac-address’ with the MAC of the end-system to
immediately trigger a re-auth. The re-auth then triggers a
re-assessment of the end-system which should then immediately change
its authorization state from ACCEPT to QUARANTINE or vise versa. This
feature is only used if the reassess_endsystem feature is also
enabled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use HTTPS for XAPI calls:</strong> Enable this to use HTTPS instead of
HTTP for any XAPI communication with all XOS switches. If enabled,
you will also need to install the SSH mod on all XOS switches and
configure “enabled web https”. This option is only used if the
reauthenticate_endsystem_using_xapi feature is also enabled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Username to connect to any XOS switch if no CLI credentials are
provided within XMC:</strong> If the feature
reauthenticate_endsystem_using_xapi is enabled, the solution will
need to authenticate on all XOS switches to perform re-authentication
of end-systems. It will try to retrieve the corresponding username
and password from the configured CLI credentials from XMC but if
there aren’t any for a particular switch, then this default value
will be used</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Password to connect to any XOS switch if no CLI credentials are
provided within XMC:</strong> If the feature
reauthenticate_endsystem_using_xapi is enabled, the solution will
need to authenticate on all XOS switches to perform re-authentication
of end-systems. It will try to retrieve the corresponding username
and password from the configured CLI credentials from XMC but if
there aren’t any for a particular switch, then this default value
will be used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Name of the ePO client task that Connect uses to trigger an agent
wake up:</strong> Use the exact name as defined in ePO. If you haven’t done
so far, define a client task in ePO that will wake up a client’s
agent. This is required if you want Connect to wake up the agent on
quarantined end-systems for which a client update task has been
triggered. By default, ePO agents only report their DAT version to
the ePO server once per hour. Therefore, Connect will only realize
that an end-system has updated to the latest DAT Version after quite
a long time and thus that end-system might be quarantined for quite a
long time. Sending the latest DAT version to the ePO server through
an agent wake up task will improve the behavior and get end-systems
out of their quarantine state quicker</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time before the agent wake up client task is triggered after a
quarantine event and update task trigger:</strong> In case an end-system was
quarantined by NAC the code is triggering an ePO client update task.
This task will try to update the DAT version on the end-system
through the ePO agent. This process might take a few minutes. After a
successful update, the ePO agent is not immediately reporting the
current client DAT version back to the ePO server - it will only
report this using its standard poll interval which is typically set
to run once per hour. So in a worst case scenario, an end-system gets
quarantined, we trigger a client update and then it takes a full hour
after the agent reports the updated DAT version and Connect can read
that version and then move that end-system out of quarantine! To
improve the behavior and shorten the time that end-systems spend in
quarantine you can use this parameter which will trigger a client
task on the ePO server that wakes up the corresponding agent x
seconds after we have triggered the client update task. Setting this
value to 0 disables this feature. Default: 0.</p></li>

Extreme Control assessment adapter. The adapter is implemented using
this script – which has a different location depending on the XMC
version used.</p>
<div class="section" id="xmc-version-8-1-and-previous">
<h4>XMC Version 8.1 and previous<a class="headerlink" href="#xmc-version-8-1-and-previous" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This version uses a folder called “Connect.war” which contains the
launchAS.sh script in the following sub-folder.</p>
<p>Linux:</p>
<p><em>&lt;Extreme Management

<p>Windows:</p>
<p><em>&lt;Extreme Management
CenterRootdir&gt;wildflystandalonedeploymentsConnect.warassessmentlaunchAS.cmd</em></p>
<p>You will first need to set the executable bit on that script in a Linux
environment to make the script executable:</p>
<p><em>cd
/usr/local/Extreme_Networks/NetSight/wildfly/standalone/deployments/Connect.war/assessment/</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="xmc-version-8-2">
<h4>XMC Version 8.2<a class="headerlink" href="#xmc-version-8-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This version uses a folder called “Connect.ear” which consists of
multiple sub-folder and war files. You first need to unzip the
connect-web.war file to be able to reach the launchAS.sh script
properly. Go into the Connect.ear folder and perform these two steps</p>
<p><em>mv connect-web.war connect-web.war.zip</em></p>
<p><em>unzip connect-web.war.zip -d connect-web.war</em></p>
<p>Now you can change into the corresponding folder which holds the script:</p>

<p>Ensure the script is executable:</p>
<p><em>chmod +x launchAS.sh</em></p>
<p>You can then try to start the script manually just to ensure it works:</p>
<p><em>./launchAS.sh</em></p>
<p>If it worked, you will see a very long line of text showing the startup
of the Java Virtual Machine including all its Java libraries.</p>
<p>Then hit CTR-C to stop the script.</p>
<p>To properly start the script as a daemon process running in the

<p>The first line will just change into the correct directory where the
launchAS.sh script is located. The second line will execute that script
using the “nohup” signal which tells Linux to disconnect the process
that started the script from the process running it (send to
background). It also redirects any startup output to the file</p>
<p><em>/usr/local/Extreme_Networks/NetSight/wildfly/standalone/deployments/Connect.war/assessment/launchAS-startup.log</em></p>
<p><em>Or</em></p>
<p><em>/usr/local/Extreme_Networks/NetSight/wildfly/standalone/deployments/Connect.ear/connect-web/assessment/launchAS-startup.log</em></p>
<p>which can be verified later to ensure proper startup.</p>
<p>Now manually start the script using</p>
<p><em>service rc.local start</em></p>
<p>To verify that the script was started and is running, you should</p>
<ul>
<li><p>run this command and make sure there is exactly one process that runs

<li><p>run this command and make sure that it shows exactly one line for
port 8448:</p>
<p><em>netstat -an | grep 8448</em></p>

the <em>quarantine event handling</em> process within Connect.</p>

</li>
<li><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Depending on the configured poll interval of the McAfee Connect
  module and when it was last running the next Connect <em>update
  cycle process</em> will start. If you configured, for example, a 6
  minute poll interval on the Connect McAfee ePO module, it could
  take up to 6 minutes after the Connect <em>quarantine event

<p>The whole process starting with NAC quarantining and end-system and ending with end-system being fully updated and back in its “normal” policy/VLAN can take multiple minutes. Realistic values seen in tests: 12 minutes. This process time is mainly made up of:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Time it takes for ePO to update the client – recommended wait time to configure in Connect: 6 minutes. This could be lowered but if ePO hasn’t updated the client after those x minutes, Connect will trigger the agent wakeup task too early and it might take up to another hour until the client will actually be updated in ePO and Connect/NAC can undo the quarantine state!</p></li>
<li><p>Time it takes for ePO to wakeup the agent and update its client status. Connect is currently not waiting for this to finish. Connect will simply read the end-system’s status during its next update cycle.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So if, for example, the agent wakeup task is triggered at 15:00 and the next Connect update cycle runs 2 minutes later at 15:02 ePO might not yet have update the end-system’s state so Connect won’t push the end-system out of quarantine yet as the ePO server still shows the out-of-date DAT version! Only on the next Connect update cycle (assuming a poll interval of 6 minutes) at 15:08 will Connect realize that the client was updated by ePO and push it out of quarantine. Using this example: Best case, the full process will take a bit more than 6 minutes, worst case it might take more than 12 minutes.</p>

feature forces the immediate enforcement of the quarantine
state for out-of-date end-systems.</p>

</ol>
<p>8.1. If the feature to re-authenticate end-systems using XAPI is
disabled, Connect will trigger NAC to force a re-auth using its standard
mechanisms (see 8.2). Some XOS switches are not supported by those
mechanisms. In these cases, this feature should be enabled. If enabled,
Connect will retrieve the corresponding end-system from NAC and augment
it with the switch data where this end-system is connected to.</p>
<p>8.2. Connect is triggering NAC to re-auth and re-assess the end-system.
This might not work on some XOS switches (see 8.1.). Even in that case,
this step is important since it will tell NAC to assess this end-system
as soon as it re-authenticates the next time.</p>
<p>8.3. Trigger a re-authentication of this end-system on its access
switch using the XAPI and the following CLI command:
<em>clear netlogin state mac-address &lt;MAC&gt;</em>
This feature is only meant for supporting older XOS switches which
cannot re-authenticate end-system based on standard features provided
by NAC (SNMP MIB or COA).
This will force the switch to send a new RADIUS authentication request
towards NAC. Since Connect told NAC to reassess the end-system on the
next occurance of a re-authentiation (see 8.2.), NAC will now assess
the end-system. NAC is configured to assess the end-system via the
“FusionAssessmentAdapter” (=launchAS.sh script/assessment adatper)
which in turn asks the internal Connect assessment storage. Within
that storage, this end-system has been marked with a <em>high risk</em> value
for the <em>DeviceOutOfDate</em> test and thus NAC will quarantine the
end-system. Quarantining an end-system could mean: push the end-system
to the Quarantine VLAN or Policy or similar – depending on the NAC
Profile configuration.</p>
<p>8.4. Step 8.5 is only executed if the following requirements are met:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The end-system state has changed from Accept to Quarantine this
ensures that Connect is not triggering a client update task during
each cycle as long as the end-system stays in the Quarantine state</p></li>
<li><p>Connect doesn’t have a running ePO client update task already. This
check tries to find an entry for the end-system MAC address within
the list of triggered client update task timestamps. This list holds
one entry for each MAC address for which Connect triggered an ePO
client update task recently. The time an entry lives on that list can
be modified using config property
<em>“Time before client update task is aborted by EPO”</em></p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>8.5. Trigger client update task: calls the McAfee ePO API task that
triggers a client update immediately. Also adds +1 to the number of
triggered ePO client tasks for that end-system for that day and
memorizes when this task was started (so Connect doesn’t start multiple
client update tasks simultaneously)</p>

<p>This section provides information related to verifying that your

general, be aware that any data (including assessment data) will only be
updated during the configured update intervals. For example, if you
update only once per day, do not expect any updates within NAC more than
exactly once per day. Also be aware of the fact that any data retrieved
from ePO and any action triggered in direction to XMC are handled by the
Control module, which has its own update interval and needs to pickup
any changes/updates from ePOHandler and push it to XMC. Depending on the
number of changes/actions during one cycle and the number of end-systems

end-system table under the “Identity and Access” tab and display the
custom data field which you have configured for the McAfeeEPOHandler.
You might need to make the corresponding column visible first. If you

<p>Another option is to use the general “Search” tab and search for an
end-system which is managed by ePO. It should find the end-system and
display ePO data as shown below.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Assessment</a><a class="headerlink" href="#assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This section describes the process a devices will follow if it its DAT
file is running out-of-date and the corresponding assessment features
are enabled.</p>
<p>A healthy device did not update to the latest ePO DAT version and is
thus running a DAT version which is older than X versions configured in
the ePO handler config file. Once Connect recognizes the outdated DAT
file it will populate that fact to the assessment adapter and also try
to trigger the corresponding client update script. If NAC triggers an
assessment for this end-system before the device could be updated, it
will recognize that the device is out-of-date and needs to be
quarantined:</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="../../_images/image191.png"><img alt="image19" src="../../_images/image191.png" style="width: 6.27014in; height: 2.33631in;" /></a></p>

<p>At this stage, the device should have a policy (or VLAN) that doesn’t
allow it to harm other network devices or services but still allows the
ePO server to contact and update it.</p>
<p>Once ePO has successfully updated the device and the next Connect update
cycle ran, the assessment adapter will receive the updated info (from
Connect) that the device is no longer out-of-date. Connect will then
immediately trigger a re-assessment within NAC which will lead to
re-authorizing the device into its proper policy (VLAN) since the new
assessment result showed that the device is compliant and the DAT is not
out-of-date anymore.</p>

the ePO API</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that you can telnet from the XMC server to the ePO server’s
IP and configured TCP port (so Connect can talk to the API on that IP
and port)</p></li>
<li><p>Are you sure that the devices managed by ePO are more or less the
same as those managed within NAC? Connect will only import and push
data for those MAC addresses which are matching in ePO and NAC.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Issue: I don’t get the DAT version imported correctly in NAC and the
assessment regarding the DAT out-of-date value isn’t working
properly.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Did you also rollout McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.8 to the agents
running on your devices? Can you verify by using your ePO web
management and navigate to a device whether ePO shows the correct DAT
version within the device’s Products section?</p></li>
<li><p>If a device has just recently been added to ePO it might already be
managed by ePO but VSE might not yet have been rolled out so there is
no DAT version to retrieve at this stage. This should update
automatically lateron.</p></li>
